    <p>Tender, flaky salmon is spiced simply but sublimely, then baked in the oven in foil, this lemon pepper salmon is exactly the kind of recipe you and I need more of in our lives.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>Salmon</li>
        <li>Lemon</li>
        <li>Black Pepper</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Arrange the salmon on a sheet of foil, then drizzle with olive oil. Season, then top with herbs and lemon slices.</li>
        <li>Fold the foil around the salmon to make a packet. Bake salmon at 375 degrees F for 18-21 minutes as suggested in my baked salmon temperature guide, until the salmon flakes easily with a fork.</li>
